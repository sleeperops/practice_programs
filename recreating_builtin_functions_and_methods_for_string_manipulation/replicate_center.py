# Prompt the user to enter a sample text, the length of the text and the padding character which will be used to center the text
# Initialize text_input as the sample text, length_input as the length of the sentence and pad_char_input as the padding character.
# To determine the ammount of padding that will be used to center the text, subtract length_input from len(text_input)
# Divide it by two. In the case of odd numbers wherein the difference is not equal, store the bigger half into 'prefix'.
# Store the smaller half into 'suffix'.
# # Print the prefix at the start, the text_input in the middle and the suffix at the end.
