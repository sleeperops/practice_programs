# displays all inputs with duplicates

# initialize a list_called 'input_list'
# initialize an 'occurrence_counter_dict' dictionary to count how many times the number occured
# run a for loop 10 times
# for each loop, ask an input
# append each input in input_list
# run a for loop in the input_list
# for every loop, check if the number is in the occurrence_counter_dict
# if not, append the number in occurrence_counter_dict as a key with a value of 1,  implying that the number only appeared once
# > the key will refer to the number, and the value will refer to the occurence of that number
# if it already exist in occurrence_counter_dict, add 1 to the value, implying that the number appeared more than once

# use a for loop to loop through occurrence_count_dict
# for every loop, check if the corresponding value of the key is more than 1
# if it is more than 1, store in a list called 'marked_as_duplicates'.
# print 'marked_as_duplicates' to display a list of duplicating numbers
