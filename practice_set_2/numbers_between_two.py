# prints all numbers in between two numbers

# enter the first input
# enter the second input
# use try and except to make sure the outputs are integers
# if first input is smaller, make it as the minimum value(floor), and make the second input the maximum value (ceiling)
# if second input is smaller, make it as the minimum value(floor), and make the first input the maximum value (ceiling)
# else make it equal
# run a for loop from the minimum(floor) value up to the maximum value(ceiling)
# print the numbers in between
