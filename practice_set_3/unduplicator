# use a for loop to ask for ten numbers
# initialize a list named 'input_numbers' that will store all of the inputs
# initialize an empty list named 'unduplicating_list'
# run a for loop in the 'input_numbers' list
# for every loop check if the numbers in that list is in the unduplicating list
# if not, add it
# else if its already in the list, skip
# print the unduplicating list
