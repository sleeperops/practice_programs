# use a for loop to ask for ten numbers
# initialize a list named 'input_numbers' that will store all of the inputs
# initialize an empty list named 'unduplicating_list'
# initialize an empty list named 'marked_as_duplicate'
# run a for loop in the 'input_numbers' list
# for every loop check if the numbers in that list is in the unduplicating list
# if not, add it
# elif its already in the list, add the number to marked_as_duplicate
# run another for loop in unduplicating_list
# for every loop, check if the item is in marked_as_duplicate
# if it is, remove the item from the list
# print the unduplicating list
