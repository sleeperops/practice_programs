# sorts a list of numbers
# initialize a list called input_list
# run a while loop as long as it is true
# for every loop, ask the user for an input
# try if the input can be converted to an integer
# > if so add the number to the input_numbers list
# else if it is not an integer print 'not a number' and break from the loop
# sort the input_numbers list using sort() method
